# Getting Started

### How to run the application locally
Make sure the configured **server.port** property in application.properties
is not being used by any other resource on your machine.

There are 2 fields in application.properties:

**spring.mail.username**

**spring.mail.password**

Both the username and password need to be valid existing credentials 
because they are used as the sender's info.

The password needs to be an App password, which is generated the following way:

**Open your google account and go to security -> 
type App passwords in the search bar. Open that menu and create an app password.
Use that password in the crypto-newsletter project**

**Example:**

spring.mail.username=some_email@gmail.com

spring.mail.password=app-password

The field mail.sender also needs to be given some value that will
act as the sender of the emails

**Example:**

mail.sender=any_mail@gmail.com

The field spring.cloud.openfeign.client.config.coin-gecko.default-request-headers.x-cg-demo-api-key
needs to have a value which is an api-key. It can be generated by
logging into CoinGecko and creating a free plan token

After these settings are set, the user needs to run the following
command in the terminal of his IDE while in the folder of the
crypto-newsletter project:

**docker-compose up -d**

This will startup the Kafka container and create the required topics in it
